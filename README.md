### Nashville Software School Project - Rock-and-Roll Marathon and Half-Marathon Race Results (2016 - 2019)  

This was my first project with Nashville Software School. The purpose was to get familiar with Excel. It is simple analysis on the [Rock-and-Roll Marathon](https://www.runrocknroll.com/Events/Nashville/The-Races/Marathon/) data. I worked in a group for this project along with ([Cristina Attfield](https://github.com/cattfield) and [Antonio Frederick](https://github.com/430modena)), but the analysis tab in the Marathon Data spreadsheet is my own work. This was my first project with Nashville Software School.
